# binaryFile
This project is a C++ command-line tool that demonstrates how to read, manipulate, and write binary files. It provides functionality for reading files in chunks, extracting specific bytes, and writing processed data into a new file.
//learning how to manipulate, read, extract binary files

# Features
File Handling: Open and read binary files safely.
Chunked Reading: Process files in small chunks to handle large data efficiently.
Byte Extraction: Seek to specific positions and extract selected bytes.
Data Writing: Write extracted content into a new binary file.
Error Handling: Graceful handling of file operations and errors.
